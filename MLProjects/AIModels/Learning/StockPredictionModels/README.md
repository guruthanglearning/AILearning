Open_Close_Pct = (Close - Open) / Open      # Daily change percentage
```

#### **B) Moving Averages (8 features)**
```python
# Trend indicators for different timeframes
MA_5  = Close.rolling(5).mean()             # Short-term trend
MA_10 = Close.rolling(10).mean()            # Medium-term trend  
MA_20 = Close.rolling(20).mean()            # Monthly trend
MA_50 = Close.rolling(50).mean()            # Quarterly trend

# Price-to-MA ratios (momentum indicators)
Price_MA_5_Ratio  = Close / MA_5            # Short-term momentum
Price_MA_10_Ratio = Close / MA_10           # Medium-term momentum
Price_MA_20_Ratio = Close / MA_20           # Monthly momentum

BB_Upper, BB_Lower = bollinger_bands(Close, 20)  # Bollinger Bands
BB_Position = (Close - BB_Lower) / (BB_Upper - BB_Lower)  # Position within bands
```

#### **📊 Feature Engineering Output:**
- **Total Features**: 22 technical indicators
- **Data Shape**: Original 6 columns → 28 columns (6 original + 22 features)

```python
# Will the stock go UP or DOWN tomorrow?
Next_Day_Return = Close.shift(-1) / Close - 1
Direction_Up = (Next_Day_Return > 0).astype(int)
# Output: 1 = Up, 0 = Down
```

#### **B) Price Prediction (Regression)**
```python
# What will be the exact closing price tomorrow?
Next_Day_Price = Close.shift(-1)
# Output: Actual dollar price (e.g., $234.50)
```

#### **C) Volatility Prediction (Multi-class Classification)**
```python
# Will tomorrow be Low/Medium/High volatility?
Next_Day_Volatility = Volatility_20.shift(-1)
Volatility_Class = pd.cut(Next_Day_Volatility, bins=3, labels=['Low', 'Medium', 'High'])
# Output: Low/Medium/High volatility category
```

---

### **Step 4: 📊 Data Preparation & Splitting**

#### **🔧 Data Cleaning Process:**
```python
# Remove rows with missing values after feature engineering
clean_data = data.dropna()  # Removes ~50 rows due to rolling windows

# Feature selection (exclude target variables and raw prices)
feature_columns = [all numeric columns except targets]
X = clean_data[feature_columns]  # 22 features
y = clean_data[target_column]    # Selected target
```

#### **⏰ Time Series Splitting (Critical for Stock Data):**
```python
# TIME-AWARE splitting (no random shuffle!)
split_idx = int(len(X) * 0.8)   # 80% for training, 20% for testing

# Training set: Earlier dates (e.g., 2022-2023)
X_train = X.iloc[:split_idx]     # First 80% of days
y_train = y.iloc[:split_idx]

# Test set: Later dates (e.g., 2024-2025) 
X_test = X.iloc[split_idx:]      # Last 20% of days
y_test = y.iloc[split_idx:]
```

#### **🎯 Feature Scaling:**
```python
# Normalize features for algorithms like SVM and Logistic Regression
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

#### **📊 Data Split Results:**
- **Training Set**: ~400 days (80% of data)
- **Test Set**: ~100 days (20% of data)  
- **Features**: 22 technical indicators (standardized)
- **Time Order**: Preserved for realistic backtesting

## 📊 **Comprehensive AI Model Metrics Guide**

### **🎯 Understanding Core Performance Metrics**

This section provides in-depth explanations of the key metrics used to evaluate AI model performance in stock prediction, with practical examples and interpretation guidelines.

---

### **📈 R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

#### **🔍 Definition**
R² measures how much of the variance in stock prices your AI model can explain, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 (higher = better).

#### **🧮 Mathematical Formula**
```python
# R² = 1 - (Sum of Squared Residuals / Total Sum of Squares)
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

# Example calculation:
actual_prices = [150.0, 152.0, 148.0, 155.0, 153.0]
predicted_prices = [149.5, 151.8, 148.2, 154.5, 152.7]

r2 = r2_score(actual_prices, predicted_prices)
print(f"R² Score: {r2:.4f}")  # Output: R² Score: 0.9712
```

#### **🎯 AI Model Perspective**
- **R² = 0.0**: Your model performs no better than just predicting the average price
- **R² = 0.30**: Model explains 30% of price movements (minimum acceptable)
- **R² = 0.70**: Model explains 70% of price movements (excellent)
- **R² = 1.0**: Perfect prediction (rarely achievable in real markets)

#### **📊 Real-World Example**
```python
# AAPL Stock Example:
actual_price = 175.00    # Yesterday's closing price
predicted_price = 174.25  # Your model's prediction
variance_explained = 0.72  # R² score

print(f"✅ Model explains {variance_explained*100:.0f}% of AAPL price movements")
print(f"📊 This means your AI captured most major price patterns")
print(f"💡 Remaining 28% is market noise/unpredictable factors")
```

#### **🎚️ Performance Thresholds**
| **R² Range** | **AI Model Performance** | **Business Interpretation** |
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **≥ 0.70** | 🌟 **Excellent** | Production-ready, captures most patterns |
| **≥ 0.50** | ✅ **Good** | Strong predictive ability, reliable |
| **≥ 0.30** | ⚠️ **Acceptable** | Some predictive value, needs improvement |
| **< 0.30** | ❌ **Poor** | Little better than random guessing |

---

### **💰 RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**

#### **🔍 Definition**
RMSE measures the average prediction error in dollars, penalizing large errors more heavily than small ones.

#### **🧮 Mathematical Formula**
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Example calculation:
actual_prices = [175.00, 176.50, 174.20, 178.30, 177.10]
predicted_prices = [174.50, 176.80, 173.90, 177.95, 176.85]

rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(actual_prices, predicted_prices))
print(f"RMSE: ${rmse:.2f}")  # Output: RMSE: $0.42
```

#### **🎯 AI Model Perspective**
RMSE tells you how "wrong" your predictions are on average, but in dollars rather than percentages.

#### **📊 Real-World Context**
```python
# Stock Price Context Matters:
stock_price = 200.00
rmse_value = 2.50

percentage_error = (rmse_value / stock_price) * 100
print(f"📊 Stock Price: ${stock_price}")
print(f"🎯 RMSE: ${rmse_value}")
print(f"📈 Percentage Error: {percentage_error:.1f}%")

# Interpretation:
if percentage_error <= 1.5:
    print("🌟 Excellent precision for trading decisions")
elif percentage_error <= 3.0:
    print("✅ Good precision for investment decisions")
elif percentage_error <= 5.0:
    print("⚠️ Acceptable for trend analysis")
else:
    print("❌ Too imprecise for reliable use")
```

#### **🎚️ Performance Guidelines**
| **Stock Price Range** | **Excellent RMSE** | **Good RMSE** | **Acceptable RMSE** |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **$50-$100** | **< $1.00** | **< $2.00** | **< $3.00** |
| **$100-$200** | **< $2.00** | **< $4.00** | **< $6.00** |
| **$200-$500** | **< $4.00** | **< $8.00** | **< $12.00** |

### **📐 MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**

#### **🔍 Definition**
MAPE measures prediction accuracy as a percentage, making it scale-independent and easy to interpret across different stock prices.

#### **🧮 Mathematical Formula**
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_mape(actual, predicted):
    """Calculate MAPE with example"""
    mape = np.mean(np.abs((actual - predicted) / actual)) * 100
    return mape

# Example:
actual_prices = [150.0, 200.0, 75.0, 300.0]
predicted_prices = [148.5, 202.0, 76.0, 295.0]

mape = calculate_mape(np.array(actual_prices), np.array(predicted_prices))
print(f"MAPE: {mape:.2f}%")  # Output: MAPE: 1.42%
```

#### **🎯 AI Model Perspective**
MAPE is ideal for comparing model performance across different stocks and price ranges.

#### **📊 Practical Trading Examples**
```python
# Different scenarios:
scenarios = [
    {"actual": 150.00, "predicted": 147.50, "scenario": "Conservative prediction"},
    {"actual": 150.00, "predicted": 165.00, "scenario": "Overoptimistic prediction"},
    {"actual": 150.00, "predicted": 149.25, "scenario": "Precise prediction"}
]

for scenario in scenarios:
    actual, predicted = scenario["actual"], scenario["predicted"]
    mape = abs((actual - predicted) / actual) * 100
    
    print(f"\n{scenario['scenario']}:")
    print(f"   Actual: ${actual:.2f}, Predicted: ${predicted:.2f}")
    print(f"   MAPE: {mape:.2f}%")
    
    if mape <= 2.0:
        print("   ✅ Excellent for day trading")
    elif mape <= 5.0:
        print("   ✅ Good for swing trading")
    elif mape <= 10.0:
        print("   ⚠️ Acceptable for long-term investing")
    else:
        print("   ❌ Too inaccurate for trading decisions")
```

#### **🎚️ MAPE Performance Standards**
| **MAPE Range** | **AI Model Quality** | **Trading Application** |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **≤ 2.0%** | 🌟 **Exceptional** | Day trading, scalping |
| **≤ 5.0%** | ✅ **Excellent** | Swing trading, options |
| **≤ 7.0%** | ✅ **Good** | Position trading |
| **≤ 10.0%** | ⚠️ **Acceptable** | Long-term investing |
| **> 10.0%** | ❌ **Poor** | Needs significant improvement |

### **🎯 SVM (Support Vector Machine) - Classification**

#### **🔍 AI Model Definition**
SVM finds the optimal decision boundary to separate UP and DOWN stock movements by maximizing the margin between classes.

#### **🧠 How SVM Thinks**
```python
# SVM Decision Process Example:
def svm_decision_example():
    """Illustrate how SVM makes decisions"""
    
    # Market conditions (features):
    features = {
        'RSI': 65,           # Momentum indicator
        'MA_Ratio': 1.05,    # Price vs moving average
        'Volume_Ratio': 1.8  # Volume vs average
    }
    
    # SVM learned patterns:
    svm_rules = """
    📊 SVM Learned Patterns:
    - High RSI (>70) + Low Volume → Usually DOWN
    - Low RSI (<30) + High Volume → Usually UP  
    - Price above MA + High Volume → Usually UP
    """
    
    print(svm_rules)
    print(f"🎯 Current features: {features}")
    print(f"🤖 SVM Decision: Based on support vectors (key historical examples)")
    print(f"📈 Boundary distance: +0.3 → Prediction: UP")

svm_decision_example()
```

#### **🎯 SVM Performance Characteristics**
- **Accuracy Range**: Typically 52-58% for stock direction
- **Memory Efficient**: Only stores "support vectors" (key data points)
- **Robust to Outliers**: Focuses on decision boundary, not individual points
- **Non-linear Capable**: RBF kernel captures complex patterns

#### **📊 SVM Confidence Interpretation**
```python
# Example SVM output interpretation:
svm_results = {
    'prediction': 1,  # UP
    'decision_function': 0.35,  # Distance from boundary
    'probability': 0.67  # 67% confidence
}

print(f"🎯 SVM Prediction: {'UP' if svm_results['prediction'] == 1 else 'DOWN'}")
print(f"📏 Boundary Distance: {svm_results['decision_function']:.2f}")
print(f"🎲 Confidence: {svm_results['probability']:.1%}")

if svm_results['decision_function'] > 0.5:
    print("🌟 High confidence prediction")
elif svm_results['decision_function'] > 0.2:
    print("✅ Moderate confidence prediction")
else:
    print("⚠️ Low confidence - be cautious")
```

### **📈 SVR (Support Vector Regression) - Price Prediction**

#### **🔍 AI Model Definition**
SVR creates a "tolerance tube" around price predictions, focusing on capturing the main trend while being robust to price spikes.

#### **🧠 How SVR Works**
```python
# SVR Prediction Process:
def svr_prediction_example():
    """Demonstrate SVR tolerance concept"""
    
    # SVR learned to predict within a tolerance band:
    current_price = 175.00
    svr_prediction = 176.50
    epsilon = 1.00  # Tolerance band
    
    tolerance_range = (svr_prediction - epsilon, svr_prediction + epsilon)
    
    print(f"📊 Current Price: ${current_price:.2f}")
    print(f"🎯 SVR Prediction: ${svr_prediction:.2f}")
    print(f"📏 Tolerance Band: ${tolerance_range[0]:.2f} - ${tolerance_range[1]:.2f}")
    
    if tolerance_range[0] <= current_price <= tolerance_range[1]:
        print("✅ Actual price within tolerance - SVR was 'correct'")
    else:
        print("❌ Actual price outside tolerance - SVR missed")
    
    # SVR advantage:
    print("\n🌟 SVR Advantages:")
    print("- Robust to price spikes and outliers")
    print("- Good for volatile stocks")
    print("- Captures overall trend direction")

svr_prediction_example()
```

#### **🎯 SVR Performance Characteristics**
- **R² Range**: Typically 0.50-0.75 for price prediction
- **Outlier Resistant**: Less affected by extreme price movements
- **Smooth Predictions**: Reduces noise in volatile markets
- **Tolerance-Based**: Focuses on getting "close enough" rather than exact

#### **📊 SVR vs Other Models**
```python
# Model comparison for volatile TSLA stock:
model_comparison = {
    'Linear Regression': {
        'r2': 0.45, 'rmse': 8.50, 'mape': 4.2,
        'characteristics': 'Sensitive to outliers, simple'
    },
    'Random Forest': {
        'r2': 0.68, 'rmse': 6.20, 'mape': 3.1,
        'characteristics': 'Complex patterns, overfitting risk'
    },
    'SVR': {
        'r2': 0.62, 'rmse': 6.80, 'mape': 3.4,
        'characteristics': 'Robust, stable, good for volatility'
    }
}

print("📊 Model Performance Comparison (TSLA):")
print("=" * 50)
for model, metrics in model_comparison.items():
    print(f"\n🤖 {model}:")
    print(f"   R²: {metrics['r2']:.2f} | RMSE: ${metrics['rmse']:.2f} | MAPE: {metrics['mape']:.1f}%")
    print(f"   💡 {metrics['characteristics']}")

### **⚖️ MINIMUM PERFORMANCE THRESHOLDS**

| **Model Type** | **Metric** | **Minimum** | **Good** | **Excellent** | **Business Logic** |
|----------------|------------|-------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **🎯 Direction Prediction** | **Accuracy** | **≥ 45%** | ≥ 55% | ≥ 60% | Better than terrible, learning patterns |
| | **CV Score Mean** | **≥ 40%** | ≥ 50% | ≥ 55% | Consistent across different time periods |

| | **MAPE** | **≤ 10.0%** | ≤ 7.0% | ≤ 5.0% | Acceptable prediction error |
| | **RMSE** | *Stock-dependent* | Lower is better | Context-specific | Relative to price volatility |

---

### **🔍 Threshold Rationale Explained**

#### **🎯 Direction Prediction (Classification)**

**📊 Accuracy ≥ 45% (Minimum)**
```python
# Why 45%? Context matters:
random_baseline = 50.0  # Coin flip accuracy
market_difficulty = 0.95  # Stock prediction is 95% as hard as random
minimum_threshold = random_baseline * market_difficulty  # = 47.5%
practical_minimum = 45.0  # Rounded down for learning tolerance

# Real-world context:
professional_traders = "52-58%"  # Industry performance
your_learning_goal = "45%+"     # Reasonable learning target
```

**📈 CV Standard Deviation ≤ 15%**
```python
# Stability check - model shouldn't be random
cv_scores = [0.52, 0.48, 0.55, 0.49, 0.53]  # 5-fold CV
std_dev = np.std(cv_scores)  # = 0.027 (2.7%)
if std_dev <= 0.15:  # 15% tolerance
    print("✅ Model is stable and reliable")
else:
    print("❌ Model is too inconsistent for use")
```

#### **💰 Price Prediction (Regression)**

**📊 R² Score ≥ 0.30 (Minimum)**
```python
# R² interpretation:
r2_score = 0.35
variance_explained = r2_score * 100  # 35%
print(f"Model explains {variance_explained}% of price movements")

# Why 0.30 minimum?
# - Financial markets are noisy (lots of unexplainable variance)
# - 30% explanation is meaningful in finance
# - Below 30% = model barely better than using mean price
```

**📈 MAPE ≤ 10% (Maximum Error)**
```python
# Real-world impact:
actual_price = 150.00
predicted_price = 145.00
mape = abs((actual_price - predicted_price) / actual_price) * 100  # 3.33%

if mape <= 10.0:
    print("✅ Prediction error is business-acceptable")
    print(f"${predicted_price:.2f} vs actual ${actual_price:.2f}")
```

---

### **🏆 Performance Rating System**

Our models use a **traffic light system** for instant performance assessment:

```python
def rate_performance(accuracy=None, r2=None, mape=None):
    """Rate model performance with color-coded system"""
    
    if accuracy is not None:  # Classification
        if accuracy >= 0.60:
            return "🌟 EXCELLENT - Publication quality"
        elif accuracy >= 0.55:
            return "✅ GOOD - Production ready"
        elif accuracy >= 0.45:
            return "⚠️ ACCEPTABLE - Learning/development"
        else:
            return "❌ POOR - Needs major improvement"
    
    if r2 is not None:  # Regression
        if r2 >= 0.70:
            return "🌟 EXCELLENT - Exceptional predictive power"
        elif r2 >= 0.50:
            return "✅ GOOD - Strong explanatory ability"
        elif r2 >= 0.30:
            return "⚠️ ACCEPTABLE - Meaningful but limited"
        else:
            return "❌ POOR - Little predictive value"
```

---

### **🎓 Team vs Individual Threshold Setting**

#### **👥 Team-Defined Thresholds (Recommended)**
```python
class ProjectThresholds:
    """Team-agreed minimum performance standards"""
    
    # Business requirements drive these decisions
    DIRECTION_ACCURACY_MIN = 0.45    # Risk tolerance
    DIRECTION_CV_STD_MAX = 0.15      # Stability requirement
    PRICE_R2_MIN = 0.30              # Explanation threshold
    PRICE_MAPE_MAX = 10.0            # Error tolerance
    
    # Context: Educational project focused on learning
    # Production system would have stricter thresholds
```

#### **🏢 Industry-Standard Approach**
1. **Requirements Analysis**: What accuracy does the business need?
2. **Benchmark Research**: What do similar systems achieve?
3. **Risk Assessment**: Cost of false positives vs false negatives
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Start conservative, tighten based on results
